=: description How to promote competition in the browser market
# problem statement
The browser is ubiquitous in modern society.  It is the modern day operating system.  The chromium browser has ~35 million lines of code with millions of lines of code added every year.
The compeition for browsers has been dwindling.  The only people that can compete are massive billion dollar companies.
Any new "browser" that emerges are just chromium reskins.
# idea
The browser serves many use cases, they must be broken up in order to make feature sets managable for smaller teams.
# document browser
To start, create a document rendering browser only (html and css)
Support http1 and 2, and tls
Gracefully handle js by detecting if the page is empty, if it is, open a normal browser.
We could even preload links when user hovers and try tk open the browser when they click on the link?
Have a premium feature with a server running puppeteer that will render first paint and send the html and css to the browser
Maybe we focus on rendering blogs really well.
