=: description How to promote competition in the browser market

# Problem statement
The browser is ubiquitous in modern society.  It is the modern day operating system.  The chromium browser has ~35 million lines of code with millions of lines of code added every year.
The compeition for browsers has been dwindling.  The only people that can compete are massive billion dollar companies.
Any new "browser" that emerges are just chromium reskins.

# Idea
The browser serves many use cases, they must be broken up in order to make feature sets managable for smaller teams.

# Use cases
Sharing and reading documents
Linking between documents
Linking between websites
Display animations
Allow user to submit information via forms
Allow user to interact with website to display complex information (e.g. accordian, menus, drawers, etc.)
Allow the user to query for information and have that data displayed without full page reloads (AJAX)
Allow the user to have a desktop application experience

# Document browser
To start, create a document rendering browser
Support HTML 5
Support CSS 3
Support HTTP 1.1, 2.0, and TLS protocols
Gracefully handle when we cannot properly render a page by opening the link in the OS default browser.
Have a premium feature with a server running puppeteer that will render first paint and send the html and css to the browser.
Maybe we focus on rendering blogs really well.
Another idea is to not abide by the styling rules of each website and instead design a cohesive design experience.
