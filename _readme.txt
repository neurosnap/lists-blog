# Hi I'm Eric Bower.
## I'm a maker of things, open source enthusiast, a husband, and father.
I love writing lists and sharing them with people on the internet, which is why I built lists.sh.  I have a passion for open source software and I am constantly thinking of new projects to build in my free time.
Take a look at some of my lists and hopefully it will inspire you to write some of your own!
