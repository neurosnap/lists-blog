## 10:30am

Finally got a desk at a coworking space so I'm pretty excited.  I forgot a couple of items which leads me to believe I won't be staying very long today.  I really just want to get things setup and maybe get lunch downtown.

## 3:40pm

I had fun running into former coworkers.  I have a feeling it's going to be difficult for me to make it there on a regular basis.  We only have one car for three humans so it's a game of hot potato.  Also my house is much too comfortable and it was difficult to get there.

I just got out of a therapy session where she recommended that I try to check in with my feelings a couple of times a day.
I think I'll try using this journal to document it.

## 3pm

Overall in a good mood.
I'm a little worried about my wife's career because she has some serious deadlines that will impact the family.  I want to support her but nervous about getting overwhelmed with family duties, including taking care of our son.

## 9pm

Thankful and happy that me, the wife, and son all got to spend the evening together.
It was a really pleasant evening with me and the wife working together to have fun with kiddo.
